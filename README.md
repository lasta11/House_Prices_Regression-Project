# House Prices - Advanced-Regression-Project

This repository holds a project to predict the final price of each home with the datasets from Kaggle Competition using Linear Regression Model and Random Forest Model.

## Overview

* The objective of this project is to predict the final price of residential homes in Iowa, with set of explanatory variables which affect the price change of the houses using machine learning models.
* This repository holds a set of code, that can be used to prepare, data visualization, train, and predict the prices of houses using Linear Regression and Random Forest Models.

## Summary of Workdone

### Data
* Data:
  * Datasets from Kaggle: [House Prices - Advanced regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)
  * Type: The datasets are in 2 csv files (train and test)
  * Size: Train dataset - 449 KB, Test dataset- 440 KB
  * Attributes: 76 attributes with house details, for example: House ID, Lot size in square feet, Alley, Street, house condition, house-style, year built, exterior design, roof style, land slope, neighborhood, utilities, Lot Shape, Land Condition, Overall quality, Overall condition, external quality, etc.

* Preprocessing/ Clean up:
* Data Visualization: 
   * In this project, using Matplotlib, I have plotted each attribute over the final sale price of the house, to learn how each attribute affects the sales price of the house.
   * Categorical graphs helps us understand the sales price of houses differing from each category of house-type, and area.
   * Correlation graph helps to understand the price difference of houses over various house qualities and types. 

* Problem Formulation:


* Training
